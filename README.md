Project for the Machine Learning course at Luiss for BIP. This project centers around the development of a model that accurately predicts VAT Exemption codes.

Describe what is in the 4 notebooks, which discuss all the steps we took and the progress that we made

Give a good comparison of the different models: by looking at all the results, using the simplest model --> decision tree with the smallest dataset is most logical. Easily understandable. You can even plot the decision tree (however, it is massive).

We ended up implementing this final model decision tree into a usable user interface. 

Furthermore, to run this user interface, we had to create some assets. To create these, the ui_asset_creator.py file can be used.

# [Section 1] Introduction
Our project was developed to produce a model that predicts exemption VAT codes for each invoice line. Particularly using the IVAm field in the dataset. To determine the best model we pursued several avenues and picked the relevant criteria. We also implemented a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interactions with the model in dashboard form. 

# [Section 2] Methods
Proposed ideas: Features, algorithm(s), training overview, design choices

A reader should be able to recreate your environment (e.g., conda list,
conda envexport, etc

# [Section 3] Experimental Design
Any experiments you conducted to demonstrate/validate the target contribution(s) of your project; indicate the
following for each experiment:
• The main purpose: 1-2 sentence high-level explanation
• Baseline(s): describe the method(s) that you used to compare your work to.
• Evaluation Metrics(s): which ones did you use and why?

# [Section 4] Results
• Main finding(s): report your results and what you might conclude from your work.
• Include at least one placeholder figure and/or table for communicating your findings.
• All the figures containing results should be generated from the code.

# [Section 5] Conclusions
Summarize in one paragraph the take-away point from your work.
• Include one paragraph to explain what questions may not be fully answered by your work as well as natural next steps for this direction of future work.
