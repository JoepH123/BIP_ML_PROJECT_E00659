Project for the Machine Learning course at Luiss for BIP. This project centers around the development of a model that accurately predicts VAT Exemption codes.

Describe what is in the 4 notebooks, which discuss all the steps we took and the progress that we made

Give a good comparison of the different models: by looking at all the results, using the simplest model --> decision tree with the smallest dataset is most logical. Easily understandable. You can even plot the decision tree (however, it is massive).

We ended up implementing this final model decision tree into a usable user interface. 

Furthermore, in order to run this user interface, we had to create some assets. To create these, the ui_asset_creator.py file can be used.
